# CSCI 433 Project 3 - Divide and Conquer



2023-2024 Spring Semester



The goal of this project was to implement an algorithm that given n float values, 
it would find the difference between the minimum value and the maximum value to get the
maximum profit only if the minimum value was “bought” before the maximum value. 
This means that if all the float values were sorted in descending order (reverse sorted), 
then the maximum profit will be 0. My program used a Theta(nlogn) Divide and Conquer algorithm to find the maximum profit.
